1)Installed git.
2)installed sublim.
3)versions -for checking the history of files.
4)How could having easy access to the entire history of 
a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
ans:Can compare the older versions to check for an error introduced 
in development process.
5)What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
ans:
pros:There will not be many unnecessory versions.
cons:You may miss to commit and lose the changes you made(Human error)
6)Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Ans:Git deals with code which has many files so a version of each file is required for proper tracking.
7)How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log gives the info about all the commits and diff gives the difference between two commits.
8)Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Ans:For new projects.
